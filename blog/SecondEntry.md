# Viltrumites Are Pretty Mean

Wow I wouldve never saw this coming. While on Viltrum, I noticed the citizens could fly and move objects 100x their size.
After that I asked if that is something unique to them and they replied yes. And soon after their leader proclaimed that they will be heading toward Earth.
I made the error of letting them know how the planet was teaming with life. And that we are the greatest planet in the cosmos.
I guess the Viltrumites want to test that theory because after I asked what they plan to do their. They said "Conquer your pathetic excuse of a species" 
All I know is that I nor any human can fly or possess super strength. Lets see if I can stop them!
