# First Contact with Viltrumite Life

Today, I made human history. Something that has never been done. I know, I am the coolest. I came in contact with an entirely different species. They are humanoid type and seem benevolent. 
I did not know their language, so I constructed a device to communicate. Only for them to tell me "dont bother we speak english" I was absolutely shocked. 
What they said next was a bit stange. Their leader I assume rose walked to me and said "we plan to make your lives so much better" I never said my life was bad? Oh well I will see what happens!
